Welcome to my website dedicated to understanding and tracking advances in Neural Radiance Fields. Whether you are an enthusiast, a researcher, or a curious learner, this platform is designed to be a go-to resource that provides you with an in-depth analysis and comprehensive understanding of NeRFs, shedding light on its potential and future possibilities.

# Introduction

A neural radiance field is a neural network that parametrizes a continuous function mapping a 3D location and viewing direction to a volume density and color. The weights of the neural network are optimized to reconstruct a set of input images of a particular scene.
